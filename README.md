# Predictive-Maintenance-Framework-for-Miling-Machines-using-R
Designed and implemented a predictive maintenance framework for milling machines, leveraging survival analysis and machine learning methods to optimize operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and achieve a 99% accuracy rate, enhancing milling machine operational reliability and optimizing maintenance strategies.

This project delves into the domain of predictive maintenance for milling machines, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and minimize downtime through proactive fault detection. Leveraging a synthetic dataset modeled after real-world milling machine environments, our study employs a comprehensive methodology blending statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. Initially, we conduct survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards models to predict machine failures based on key operational parameters such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, and torque. Through feature engineering and upsampling techniques, we augment the predictive power of our models, resulting in significant improvements in both survival analysis outcomes and classification accuracy. Our findings showcase the efficacy of survival analysis in prognosticating failure events, while machine learning algorithms, particularly random forests, exhibit remarkable performance in classifying machine failures and identifying their types. By integrating these methodologies, our research contributes to advancing predictive maintenance strategies for milling machines, offering practical insights for implementing proactive maintenance measures in industrial settings.
